Instructions

•Write a java program that allows a user to choose the searching or sorting algorithm and request the list of items to search or sort.

•Compute the running time of the algorithms

•Determine the time complexity of your algorithm the searching and sorting algorithms.

•Display the search value or the sorted list to the user.

• Be innovative and design a user-friendly application

Note: the programming should take the list to search or sort at the running time, not compile time. [You are submitting the java code and the computed running time/time complexity of the algorithms]

Date of submission: 7th October 2021
